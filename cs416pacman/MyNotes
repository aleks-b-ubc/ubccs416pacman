Self notes and ideas.
What we got: 	Custom packet for any data.
				Co-Ordinator is the HOST. He is also PACMAN. for now.
				Person joining is going to be a HumanGhost.
				controller broadcasts entire game state via UDP
				Slaves send updates via TCP.
								
			
Current progress:	Person can host a game. Hosting functions all work.
					Host can accept connection and start playing.
					While playing controller sends the game state info
					with every tick.
					Update Slave Model 

TODO:				Receive updates when human ghost changes directions.
					Need to send updates when characters change direction (slave)
					Connect to a hosting game (slave)
